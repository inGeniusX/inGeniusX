							<h2>Our Mission</h2>
						</header>
						<p>inGeniusX was founded on the belief that every student deserves the same opportunity to an enriching
							STEM education. If you introduce a child who has faced unimaginable things - poverty, death, crime, to STEM,
							you have the capacity to save a life. Learning the complex biological systems in ecosystems, coding
							your first program, understanding the laws of physics, each first step holds the potential for a bright and rising future. 
						  </p>
						<p>
								The fact of the matter is, education saves lives.
								With inGeniusX, the goal is simple: let those in poverty, 
								disenfranchised neighborhoods, underpriviledged areas know, that they too can be the scientist, 
								doctor, or engineer that they aspire to be one day, regardless of the socioeconomic factors they were
								born into. At inGeniusX, we challenge the notion that those at the top stay at the top.

						<h2>Our Intiatives</h2>
						<h3>Apps for Education</h3>
						<p>
							Our main intiative consists of our educational app developments. With two published apps on the appstore
							and six more in progress, inGenius X looks to fuel the rise in the STEM by providing <strong>free, 
							high level education</strong> to those with a lack in resources. From the basics of math and physics, our
							apps dive deep into the fields of artificial intelligence and organic chemistry to allow for a truly
							in-depth experience for those wanting to learn.
						</p>
						<h3>Hackathons for the underpriviledged</h3>
						<p>At inGeniusX, we seek to improve access to STEM education in every way possible to every where possible, whether that be with hands 
							on learning, or through our various mobile apps. In 2020, inGeniusX will be hosting a free of cost
							<a href="hackthestreets.com">hackathon</a> at the University of North America as a hands on initiative to 
							promote STEM education to the underrepresented. With keynote tech speakers and mentors at this event, 
							this will be an extremely enriching	educational opportunity for students to explore their computer science 
							interests.

						</p>
						<h3>Building schools for those in need</h3>
						<p>As another large scale initiative to promote inclusion in STEM, inGeniusX is working to fund the creation of a school in rural China that focuses
							on the introduction and advancement of STEM education. Having been to rural china, Rayan Yu and Andrew Tran have seen the disastrous poverty
							cycle that prevents students from obtaining a high quality education. Students suffer from the lack of basic needs at their school,
							often having no bathrooms, leaking roofs, and no deks or chairs at all. By building a school with adequate resources,
							students will finally have a brighter opportunity to pursue the career waiting for them.
							 With this pursuit, we at inGeniusX seek to make our mark internationally
							in order to address global inequalities in STEM.
