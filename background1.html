										In 2018, co-founder Andrew Tran started to realize the educational inequalities in his community.
									</br>
									</br>
										Andrew's high school had just changed it's name from J.E.B. Stuart High School to 
										Justice High School to reflect the diversity of the community. There was a new school 
										mascot, new principal, and new attitude, but there was one thing that didn't change.
										The bleak educational circumstances that existed previously persisted despite the new 
										changes. Andrew's true epiphany came when he witniessed classmates not being able to 
										afford backpacks on the first day of school, when he found out that over 65% of his peers
										were on the free/reduced lunch program, and when he realized the boy next to him in class
										was an immigrant struggling to keep up with school while making ends meet.

											In 2018, co-founder Rayan Yu had only heard
											of the extreme impoverishment in rural countries.
										</br>
										</br>
											To find out and assist on his own, <strong>Rayan pioneered a two month 
											volunteering mission</strong> to the rural county of PingJiang, Hunan, China,
											a location of significant poverty for many families and children. 
											When he got there, he witnessed firsthand: the accounts he had heard
											of were more than true. Students were studying under <strong>depressingly 
											destitute conditions,</strong> with little to no progress at all.
											Throughout the trip, Rayan personally visited students homes to assist
											in their education, experiencing the true ordeals of countless
											childrens' lives. After personally tutoring, living with, and helping
											countless students for 8 hours a day, Rayan understood how fragmented 
											opportunities truly were for such an unimaginable portion of the global
											youth.

										Sharing a personal connection with education on a global and local level, 
										Rayan and Andrew <strong>sought to create a more holistic set of educational 
										opportunities for those around them.</strong> </p>
